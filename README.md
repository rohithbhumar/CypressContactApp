# CypressContactApp
Cypress specs for a simple contact app. 

Once cypress is installed on your machine, run the following command/s:
- npx cypress run. This will run all the testspecs in the e2e folder in headless mode. 
or
- npx cypress open. This will open the cypress test runner UI to run a specific spec in headed mode.
